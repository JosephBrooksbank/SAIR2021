#### TO INSTALL
* move this entire folder (du_brooksbank_joseph) to the src root of your catkin workspace (something like ~/catkin_ws/src)
* run catkin_build from the root of your catkin workspace ( ex ~/catkin_ws/ )
* source from .../catkin_ws/devel/setup.(bash|zsh) depending on what shell you are using

### TO RUN
Assuming roscore and turltesim_node are running and you have the workspace sourced from above:

rosrun du_brooksbank_joseph du_brooksbank_joseph.py

### NOTES

As I am an undergrad, I did not implement closed loop control. The D may not be perfectly symmetrical, depending on
how much the robot slipped during movement.
